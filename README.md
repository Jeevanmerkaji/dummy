# Grid-Green
# 🌿 Powering the Future Sustainably — GreenHack 2025 by ČEPS, Prague, Czech Republic

Designing energy infrastructure that coexists with nature.  
This project explores **sustainable power grid expansion** using **remote sensing**, **GIS**, and **AI**.  
We assess environmental impacts, identify **eco-friendly transmission corridors**, and model **long-term solutions** using open datasets like **Copernicus**, **CORINE Land Cover**, **ÚSES**, and **ZABAGED**.
